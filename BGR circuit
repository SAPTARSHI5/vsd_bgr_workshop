Introduction to BGR
Bandgap Reference circuit are PVT independent Voltage Reference circuits used in Integrated Circuits. It produces a constant output voltage of 1.2 which is equivalent the energy bandgap of the silicon at 0 Kelvin. Many analog subsystem and digital subsystem require power supply form LDOs. The reference Voltage of the LDOs Vref is provided by this BGR. Components like ADC, DAC, BUCK converters also require Vref.  The applications of BGR circuits are:
The applications of the BGR circuit are:
•	Low Droput Regulators
•	Analog to Digital Converters
•	Digital to Analog Converters
•	DC to DC Buck converters
Application wise BGR can be categorized as:-
•	Low Voltage BGR
•	Low Power BGR
•	High PSRR and low noise BGR 
•	Curvature compensated BGR.
The typical diagram of BGR is shown below:-
