SUMMARY:Understanding and Building Fuse Box interface
DESCRIPTION:https://webinars.sw.siemens.com/understanding-and-building-fuse-box \n \n*Fuse Controller Interface*  Embedded memories occupy a sizable percentage of area in modern-day  SOCs. As memories are designed within very strict boundaries of  technology, they are more prone to errors. So repairable memories have  become very popular in today's design. As the number of memories  increases, there is a need to build a solid infrastructure to  facilitate repair functionality. With the increasing density of  repairable memories, fuse box has also become a crucial part of the  infrastructure to store the repair data.  *The Bad*: While the customer has the freedom to choose any fuse IP he  wants from the market, there is no underlying standard interface these  IP operate in. Hence it is the responsibility of the user to create a  fuse box interface that is capable of providing a good handshake  between the pins of a fuse controller and the non-volatile fuse IP.  *The Good: *Tessent MemoryBIST solution provides a generic fuse box  interface along with a fuse box that can be utilized by the user for  evaluation & experimentation. There is a readily available interface  for TSMC nodes.  In this session, let's have a look into Tessent fusebox controller  protocol and understand the fusebox interface development &  verification process.   This webinar will explain the challenges in building a fuse controller  interface which is a key component of repair implementation in todayâ€™s  industrial designs.   * What will you learn *  1. Understand Tessent MemoryBIST repair Infrastructure  2. Understand Fuse box controller and its functions  3. Learn about Fuse box interface types and connectivity  4. Get deeper know-how on Fuse box access and programming methods  5. How can you create the interface for a third party Fuse Box.     *Who should attend*  - All DFX, DFT, test and management who are interested in creating and  utilizing a reliable repair infrastructure memory and functional...
